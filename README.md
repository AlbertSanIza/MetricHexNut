## Publisher Privacy Policy

No data is being collected by this App. But by request of the FUSION 360 Team I show the following:

1. Identify and describe the data, if any, that the App collects, how that data is collected, and all uses of that data.
- NO data is collected.

2. Confirm that any third party with whom an App shares that data will provide the same protection of that data as stated in the App’s privacy policy. Examples of such third parties are analytics tools, advertising networks and third-party SDKs, as well as legal affiliates of the Publisher (parent, subsidiary, related entities).
- NO third party involved.

3. Explain Publisher’s data retention and deletion policies.
- NO data retained therefore no deletion protocols.

4. Describe how end users can revoke consent and/or request deletion of their data.
- NOTHING to delete.
